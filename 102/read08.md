# Read: 08 - Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

* An ***expression*** is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

*Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.  They repeated an action X number of times.  

## When does a for loop stop executing?

* A ***for loop*** repeats until a specified condition evaluates to ***false***.  

## How many times will a while loop execute?

* A ***while loop*** will execute as long as a specified condition evaluates to ***true***.  This can mean it gets stuck in an infinite loop.  Which is not good.
