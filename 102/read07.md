## What is control flow?

* The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

## What is a JavaScript function?

* A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

* A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
* The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

* The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

    1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
    1. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
    1. Automatically (self invoked)

## What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

* Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
