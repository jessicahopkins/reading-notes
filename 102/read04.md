# Read: 04 - Structure Web Pages with HTML

## What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTMl (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and it's content.

## What are the 3 main parts of a HTML element?

1. **Opening Tag** - This consists of the name of the element, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.
1. **Closing Tag**  - This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
1. **Content** - This is the content of the element.

## What is called when you give an element extra information?

* *Attributes* contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

## What is a semantic element?

* A *semantic element* describes the purpose or role that an element has.
* Examples:
  * `<header>`
  * `<footer>`
  * `<article>`
  * `<nav>`
