# Read: Class 14: Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is an important aspect in company and team culture today.  Everyone wants to feel safe and be heard.

## Psychological Safety

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
    * Feeling free to share things that scare us the most without fear of retribution.  Encourage emotional conversations
    * Team members listen to each other
    * Team members show sensitivity to feelings and needs of others
1. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
    * My current team is a high producing team and we have worked very hard on psychological safety topics over the past year.  There have been very difficult moments that we had to work through, however, the hard work has payed off and we work together better then ever.  The team (mostly made up of software engineers) don't always enjoy these exercises.  They feel like if they are not "writing code" they are not doing their job.  We have had to define this as a team.  We practice feedback exercises, we share personal histories, gather outside of work and have monthly social hours to play games and share about ourselves (no work talk) to name a few.  
1. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
    * More efficient
    * Produce better results/Profitiability increases
    * Higher job satisfaction
