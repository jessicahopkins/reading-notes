## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
    * Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model designed for one-dimensional layouts.  That means, it focuses on arranging elements either horizontally or vertically.
1. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
    * The main axis is the primary axis along which the elements are laid out (horizonal - row or vertical - column)
    * The cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis
1. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
    * Order Property - allows you to change the visual order of elemens but it doesn't change the underlying source order in HTML causing a mismatch of the content.  Screen readers typically follow the source so it can make content confusing.
    * Lack of Semantic HTML: To ensure accessibility, it's important to use semantic HTML elements appropriately. Overreliance on flexbox properties to position and style elements, instead of using the right HTML elements and semantic structure, can lead to a loss of meaning and context for assistive technology users.
