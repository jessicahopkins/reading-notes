These topics are important because they review the basics of HTML and CSS and start to build on JavaScript fundamentals.  Pair programming is something you will do everyday in the industry/software development field.

## Learn HTML - Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
    * `<a>`
1. The href attribute contains what information?
    * href = hypertext reference (target).  It contains the web address or URL.
1. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
    * Use clear wording
    * Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text
    * Don't say "link"
    * Keep it short

## CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
    * The way that webpage elements lay out if you haven't changed their layout.
1. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
    * Block level elements content fills the available inline space of the parent element while, inline level elements is just the size of the content.
    * block-level are laid out vertically, each one will appear on a new line below the last one.  Inline don't appear on new lines, they will sit on same link along adjacent content.
1. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
    * Static positioning
1. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
    * It sits on its own layer separate from everything else.You can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page (think pop-ups, drag and drop features.
1. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
    * They are fixed in place (think navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls)

## Learn JS - Functions

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
    * A function declaration is the process of creating a new function in code.  It defines the functions name and parameters.  Typically starts with the "function" key word, followed by name, paramert list (enclosed in parentheses) and the body enclosed in curly braces. Function invocation executes code using a previously declared function.
1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    * A parameter defines the input that a function requires to perform its task.  Part of the declaration (inside parentheses).  Argument is the actual value that is passed to a function when its called.  Values enclosed within parentheses

## Miscellaneous - Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    * Greater efficiency - Working with others will help me talk through solutions faster, get ideas and maybe less frustrated when stuck.
    * Learning from fellow students - Seeing how others do things, navigate, etc. will teach me new ways to do things.
