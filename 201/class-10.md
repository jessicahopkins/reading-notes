These topics are important because they help you recognize and correct errors, saving you valuable time as a developer.

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
    * Syntax Error - Spelling errors in code that cause the program not to run at all or stop working part way through.
    * Logic Error - Errors where the syntax is correct but the code is not working as expected, giving incorrect results.
    * Key difference - Syntax errors usually provide some kind of error message and often time Logic errors do not display an error directing to the source of the error.
1. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
    * I've missed the semicolon and spelled varible names wrong.
    * I had a logic error when trying to add a new city to the Cookie lab.  The row was populating but the math was incorrect.  It was due to JS calculating the number as a string and not as a "number".  Used parseInt to correct the issue.
1. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
    * Errors will always happen, learning how to recognize them and fix them quickly will save you time and frustration.

## JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
    * The JS debugger allows you to inspect your code as it runs to identify bugs.  It runs in your browser and you can pause it at certain points to examine the state of your code.  It also allows you to step through the code, line by line.
1. Define what a breakpoint is.
    * Breakpoints are places in your code that you want to pause execution to identify problems that prevent your code from running properly.
1. What is the call stack?
    * The call stack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line

## Things I Want to Know More About

* Practice using the Developer tools in the browser.  I know they exist but it's not natural to go and look there yet.
